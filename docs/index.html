<!--
    This is the main website for Taskforge. It contains minimal documentation
    and all documentation should really be written in the rst files in the repo.
    This is more of a Marketing or a "first look" at Taskforge and is merely a
    landing page.

                <h2>Why use Taskforge?</h2>
                <div class="container text-left" >
                    <p>
                        Taskforge has many competitors and all of them are great
                        choices for task management. So why build yet another "todo
                        app"?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The answer is simple, most task management applications
                        require that you duplicate data into them from other
                        sources. Whether by work, or personal preference, our
                        actual tasks are managed in different sources today.
                        Whether that be JIRA, GitHub, Trello etc. the teams and
                        people we interact with rarely use the same solution as
                        we do. Furthermore, it's even less likely that you'll be
                        able to use the same systems at work and on projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The downside of all this? <strong>These systems
                        put the responsibility on you</strong> to duplicate that
                        information into a format that you can digest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is the problem that Taskforge solves. It aggregates
                        and integrates with existing systems and provides a
                        unified interface for all the various tasks systems
                        you're required to interact with.
