Configuring Taskforge
=====================

Taskforge as described above will work with a SQLite database with no
configuration. However if you would like to configure Taskforge this section
will get you started with a configuration file that will continue working as
above.

The primary location for a Taskforge configuration file is in
``$HOME/.taskforge.d/config.toml``. You can create this file using your favorite
file manager, however below we will demonstrate how to do so via a Unix
terminal:

.. console::
   
   $ mkdir ~/.taskforge.d
   $ touch ~/.taskforge.d/config.toml
