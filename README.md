This is the backend for Taskforge. This API server handles storage, retrieval,
querying tasks. Additionally it coordinates syncing with third party sources

Documentation is available at https://docs.taskforge.io

## Why Taskforge?

Taskforge has many competitors and all of them are great choices for task
management. So why build yet another "todo app"?

The answer is simple, most task management applications require that you
duplicate data into them from other sources. Whether by work, or personal
preference, our actual tasks are managed in different sources today. Whether
that be JIRA, GitHub, Trello etc. the teams and people we interact with rarely
use the same solution as we do. Furthermore, it's even less likely that you'll
be able to use the same systems at work and on projects.

The downside of all this? **These systems put the responsibility on you** to
duplicate that information into a format that you can digest.

This is the problem that Taskforge solves. It aggregates and integrates with
existing systems and provides a unified interface for all the various tasks
systems you're required to interact with.
